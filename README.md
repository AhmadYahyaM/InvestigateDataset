Introduction
Overview
To complete my Data Analysis project I am using TMDb movies dataset.
This data set contains information about 10866 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. It consist of 21 columns such as imdb_id, revenue, budget, vote_count etc.

Conclusions
This was a very interesting data analysis. After this analysis we can conclude following:
For a Movie to be in successful criteria
Average Budget must be around 74 millon dollar Average duration of the movie must be 115 minutes Any one of these should be in the cast :Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt, Adam Sendler, Sylvester Stallone. Genre must be : Action, Comedy, Adventure, Drama, Thriller. By doing all this the movie might be one of the hits and hence can earn an average revenue of around 345 million dollar.
Limitations: This analysis was done considering the movies which had a significant amount of profit of around 100 million dollar. This might not be completely error free but by following these suggestion one can increase the probability of a movie to become a hit. Moreover we are not sure if the data provided to us is completel corect and up-to-date. As mentioned before the budget and revenue column do not have currency unit, it might be possible different movies have budget in different currency according to the country they are produce in. So a disparity arises here which can state the complete analysis wrong. Dropping the rows with missing values also affected the overall analysis.
